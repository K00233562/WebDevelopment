<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>
My hobbies comsist of a combination of music and sport. I play a number of musical instruments, piano and guitar being my preference. I have classical training in piano with the<a href="http://www.riam.ie/">Royal Irish Academy of Music</a>. I also play the drums, bass, flute, bag pipes and sing a little.

<h2>My favourite music</h2>
<p>
What is my favourite music, is not a question I can answer easily. If I was to play my music on shuffle it would vary between, metal, gypsy punk, rock and then it then changes to disney and musicals. Some of the artists I would listen to are Rancid, <a href="https://www.thescriptmusic.com/">The Script</a>, Gogol Bordello, 30 seconds to mars, kate bush, and then any musical you can think of.

          "I'm very lucky to do what I do. I love writing songs. I love singing songs. However performing was a challenge for me until I moved to Miltown in 2001. It was here among the people and a town that i love that I found my voice. It was here that I wrote and recorded my album in 2015 at Malbay studios with Martin o Malley. And its here among my community where I sing the most with a residency at the Armada Hotel and various other little gems that come our way."
            
            <br><br>
        
            Shona's style is an eclectic mix of jazz folk and well shonaness!! Her songs speak of life, love and loss, of poverty, shame and discovery. Of who we are and what life brings along the way..
